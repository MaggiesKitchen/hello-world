# hello-world

Hi, coders.

Mags here. I live at the top of 110 stairs. We have skunks that skulk around at night and spiders that spin webs all day. They say to watch out for mountain lions but is that even possible? I've always heard they just snatch you when you're not even looking.

Wish me luck on this mountainside.

Over and out, M.
